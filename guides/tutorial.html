    <h1>Course Load Analytics: Introduction</h1>

<p>Welcome to the Course Load Analytics Platform!</p>
<p>Through this platform, you will receive access to AI-based predictions of course workload, which we call “Course Load Analytics.”
</p><p>Course load analytics are machine-learned predictions trained on data from past students at your institution.
These students rated courses they took on the dimensions of time load, mental effort, and psychological stress every week and at the end of the semester.
</p><p>Predictions leverage course-level data from the learning management system (e.g., Moodle, Canvas, Edmodo) and enrollment records (e.g., grade data and co-enrollment sequences).
</p><p>
Research, including at your institution, has shown that these predictions are a more accurate representation of student workload perceptions than institutionally provided credit hours.
</p><p>
Course Load Analytics break down into three dimensions, in line with common defintions of workload from psychology:
</p><p>
<ul>
<li>Time load refers to the weekly time spent on coursework.
</li><li>Mental effort refers to the concentration and attention required for course completion.
</li><li>Psychological stress refers to the confusion, frustration, and anxiety during the completion of coursework.
</li></ul>
<p> It is important to remember that all estimates represent past data and the average student's experience at your institution.
Your personal experience of workload might differ, depending on several personal factors.
</p>

    <h1>What do the different Course Load Analytics scales mean?</h1>
    
    <div class="description">
        <h2>Time Load</h2>
        <p>Time load is defined as the amount of required attention or concentration related to the completion of coursework and attendance.</p>
        <p>The scale ranges from 1 (0-5 hours per week) to 5 (21+ hours per week).</p>
